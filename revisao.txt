On one hand, exploitation consists of taking the decision assumed to be optimal with respect to the data observed so far. This « safe » approach tries to avoid bad decisions as much as possible but also prevents from discovering potential better decisions. 
On the other hand, exploration consists of not taking the decision that seems to be optimal, betting on the fact that observed data are not sufficient to truly identify the best option. This more « risky » approach can sometimes lead to poor decisions but also makes it possible to discover better ones, if there exists any.
